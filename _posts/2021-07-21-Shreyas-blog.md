**What were the most challenging moments in developing the app?**

<p>
One of the top challenges while working on the functional components was when I was trying to figure out how rshiny really worked. I think that process took some time, because this is my first time making an application. I think learning the user interface and the the server parts of making the application really helped me, but it was challenging to really understand and digest the different concepts. Another challenging time that I had communication and really just getting started. In the first week that we started working on the rShiny project, I was really confused about what we had to do and how we had to do the tasks. However once the communication became more clear it really allowed me to get started on the functional components of the app.

One of my top most enjoyable moment from the project was when I had a difficult time solving an error and I was finally able to get the code to work for the application. In week 2 when we were working on different ways to import different types of files, I ran into an error that would not let me run my code. When I finally was able to get the code to work I had a lot of self-satisfaction. Another memorable moment was when I was facing a problem with the code for data importation for series matrix files and I ran into an error; Nikita really helped me solve the problem and it was really helpful.

One unique aspect of the app that I really like is the number of different files that the user can import. To be honest I did not know that there were so many different types of file types. While researching, our team found so many different file types like .csv, .txt, .cel, and .idat. I really like that our app has the ability for the user to import so many different file types.

<p>
One main thing that I will take away from this experience is how to work on such a project with so many people. I feel like this is my first real world experience where teamwork is so crucial. Something I really took away from the experience is that team work and collaboration is so crucial because one person can not do everything. Also it taught me how to ask for help from my peers and how important it is to share the work that you have done.
