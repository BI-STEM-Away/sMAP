<p>
The most challenging moment for me is to develop the R shiny website. I am very new to GitHub, and I have no experience with the R programming language. Hence I have to figure out how to code the correct format to meet the criteria.

I really appreciate Disha’s help, although we have faced many obstacles when developing a website. I have acquired many technical skills from her, which I enjoyed the most. Aside from that, contributing to this project gives me a basic idea of how the bioinformatics industry works.

I have learned a lot from our group mates and PM, especially when developing the GitHub page. Also, the experience of using RStudio to generate plots like volcano plot, box-plot and so on is beneficial for my future study at college.

<p>
I would say teamwork is vital for a project as a whole. Without teammates and group leads’ help, the project would not end up well. Overall, I enjoyed working on this project, but it could be better if the team workflow is more organized.
