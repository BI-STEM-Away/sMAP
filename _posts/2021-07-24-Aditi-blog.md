**What were the most challenging moments in developing the app?**

<p> 
Some of the challenges were actually understanding how RShiny works as well as getting used to all the group formats. I am from level 1 which means that the RShiny project is out of the expected task, therefore, it was challenging to learn something that I didn’t know prior to the internship. Another challenge was waiting for other groups to finish their part to continue with my tasks because our group depended on other group’s progress.

Working with people in our group and others out of our group was memorable. Everyone was very cooperative which made everything more doable. It was also satisfying to be able to hold meetings and work as a manager. Especially when I successfully completed my tasks.

Working with a new coding language, RShiny, was unique. Usually, I believe only those who pursue a career in bioinformatics and other similar careers use this language, so it was a valuable experience. Meeting people from all over the world was also a new experience.

I think being a manager was stressful at some time, especially the beginning because it was such an important role and it was intimidating. The biggest takeaway is to not shy away from intimidating roles. This project especially helped me work on my public speaking skills.
