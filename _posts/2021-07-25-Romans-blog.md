**What were the most challenging moments in developing the app?**

<p>
In the beginning of this project, I found it somewhat difficult to understand what Group B2 was specifically working on, and how we were going to work with the UX Team. I also found it difficult to plan weekly tasks for Group B2 that do not depend on the code from Group A/B1.

<p>
I really enjoy working with the people in Group B2 on this project, as much of the members in Group B2 are also from Bioinformatics Group 1, which is my module group. I have also enjoyed working in R to try to realize our Figma designs into working code.

<p>
For me, I think the main take away is that learning to get to know your project teammates greatly benefits the group. If you take the time to reach out and “break the ice” with a couple online games, then everyone has more motivation to work in the group.
