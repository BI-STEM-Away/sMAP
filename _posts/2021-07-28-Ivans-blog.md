**What were the most challenging moments in developing the app?**

  <summary>Show all details</summary>

<p>
Coding. Rshiny is still new to me and this is my first time to create an app on Rshiny. I'm not very familiar with some of the codes structure and parameters to use, but I have been learning. Also, I think that could be resolved by using materials such as mastering shiny or unleash-shiny.rinterface, which has tons of examples for layout settings. Second challenge would be having a goal for the Rshiny app, and I think majority of our part is based on group A and B1 and what functions are they going to implement. However, I have also provided a template for the Rshiny from bs4Dash which should sort out many of the huddles from coding from raw.  Overall, there still arenâ€™t any big challenges for me personally since these problems should be able to sort out easily as we go along
Working with others.

So working with other people has been a joy to me, especially in our group from module checkpoints and we are mostly participating the same part of the R shiny project. So communicating with people we used to work with has really bonded us further and creating teamwork seamlessly. Although coding is a challenge for me, I do enjoy finding out new solution to deal with these problems and create/learn something new, which was one of my intention of joining this internship.

<p>
I enjoyed working making the app more user friendly. Layout stands as an important role in the app as it gives the frontend and visual presentation for people who are using this app. Therefore, designing the app to become more user friendly has been a goal for us and we are trying to separate into different part to combat this problem, as well as having an unify layout with easy-accessing buttons and functions for users.

As I mentioned previously, coding is my big interest for participating this internship. Coding will definitely be my main take away besides all other crucial and valuable elements such as teamwork and communication skills.

I think everyone has done a great job, and I hope everyone enjoyed this project, even this internship as much as I did. One thing to pinpoint is that the project's purpose should be fully developed as early as the first week to prevent hassles and confusion.
