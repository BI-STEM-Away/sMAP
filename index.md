  ## sMAP: Standard Microarray Analysis Pipeline App
  An R Shiny educational app to guide users through a interactive transcriptomics pipeline

---

Our app was made to help users understand a standard transcriptomics pipeline by taking them through the steps of microarray analysis. The app has an interactive user interface where users upload a GEO dataset and then explore and try out functions for quality control, statistical analysis, and functional analysis to find potential biomarkers.
